```
#install cobbler by cobbler
#fist time to "Automate the deployment of cobbler" by myself,maybe there are shortcomings.

#when you run this ansible scriptï¼Œyou should do follow steps:
#1:yum install ansible
#2:download CentOS-7-x86_64-Minimal-1511 iso to replace the CentOS-7-x86_64-Minimal-1511 file in cobbler/roles/cobbler/files
#3:modify the /cobbler/group_vars/all.yml to the actual IP information.
#4:ansible-playbook cobbler.yml "to install ansible."

```
